Lee:
Comin at you straight no chaser
how do I set this goddamn phaser
stuck on kill, check it later
Yeehaw verse Annihilator
Too sci-fi for this beat?
Gotta switch it up
flavor of the week
sarsaparilla
old tequila
pure agave
party killa
rippin the keef
in the back of a wagon
giddyup buttercup
this shit is slappin
jingle my spurs
my boots are tappin
west of the rockies
we still trappin

Close my eyes see the dusty trail
hit the 808 make em big as hell
Take another shot for those who gone
Here's to my homies, here's to my maw

Josh:
come and get some
good bad ugly son
spaghetti west italian
let me state my value in (gold)
old west hoes
lookin at me like I'm annie o
yeah I know
hard to ignore
6 academy awards
all best score
but I got more
cuz an oscar's only 13 inches tall
is that long enough (no)
it only weighs a pound
does it pound enough (no)
this is my acceptance speech
now have sex with me

Lee:
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
bars so hot they'll burn ya padre
Blow ya mind with my cowboy talk
I'll split your dome, bone tomahawk
Get in the zone, grab a dictionary
beat so sick, rap dysentery
Tumbleweed that's what I'm smokin
hits so hard fall over chokin
Mark ya map we making gold
but only records, no pan to hold
I got the truest grit, fist full of dollars
by high noon you'll know I'm baller
That a tombstone? Grab a plate
mad during dinner that's hate full ate
Corny puns that's unforgiven
but in the sheets magnificent seven

Tim:
clean and fresh and groomed as hell
my whole body got that old spice smell
new loofah to exfoliate
scrub a-dub-dub and I'm worth the wait
my bath game is better than the rest
old soap style
fully clean, I'm zest
took a dip in an irish spring
gotta stay fresh for my latest thing
Think your fresh rich bitch
I'm a fresh king
turkish towel when I hit the steam
take another whiff, live the dream
take two whiffs and you might get crunk
take three whiffs of my man musk funk
