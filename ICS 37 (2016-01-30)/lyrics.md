The Stone

At night when the moon is a river
A silver path pale as your skin
I make my way down to the water
To where your voice beckons me in

Your song rustles through the cattails
Each breath a pale puff on the breeze
They dance in my eyes just like fireflies
Leading me along through the reeds

Two voices now sing together
Yours so much sweeter than my own
I croak as the water rises around me
My heart heavy as a stone

The stone that I tied around you
The stone that knocked you down
The stone that you now return to me
Singing your song as I drown




Mister Clean

He serves up cool abandon
like an 80’s clarinet
slides up on a barstool
venting pure peppermint
offering an antidote
to those poison morning-after notes
you know, all the ones you never wrote

Just give up and give in
to that smile of cheap porcelain
who knows, you just might like

A night with Mister Clean
whitest sheets you’ve ever seen
his kisses sweet as grenadine
fucking in a cloud of Listerine
what a dream

He’s a catch, don’t be dumb
who cares if he still lives with mum
who knows,
one night he might even make you...

Come to your senses
don’t be so nervous
remember your past tenses
but all that can be reversed
good husbands make good fences
to keep out all those memories
well vodka and cranberry juice
random doucebag in designer heans
keeping vomit off your shoes
as he pushes you to your knees

But that can all disappear
if you get your thinking clear 
and just realize

He’s Mister Clean
wiping out what you used to be
Clorox for your memory
a future with a sparkling sheen
just don’t scream

After all the men who used to be
after all you’ve done and seen
doesn’t boring sound just like a dream
years and years ahead with Mister Clean
just don’t scream



Love Song

I don’t care about the alarm
I don’t care what my boss will say
I don’t care about your plans
I want to fuck you all day

I want to fuck every inch of you
I want you to shiver, I want you to burn
I want to fuck you every possible way
And then let you have a turn

I want to crawl inside your skin
I want your whispers and your moans
I want to devour you from within
and then I want to fuck your bones

I don’t care about the alarm
I don’t care what my boss will say
I don’t care about your plans
I want you to stay
I want to fuck you all day



Valentine’s Lament

It's a conversation we've had before
This tired romance between me and you
Yet despite my heart I can say no more

A muttered curse, the paper sleeve I tore
A crumpled card addressed to me from you
It's a conversation we've had before

Ten years of gifts and every gift's a chore
I drone my reply to your listless cue
Yet despite my heart I can say no more

Remember those loving vows we once swore
Our moonlit walks, the secret rendezvous
It's a conversation we've had before

There's a cigarette smoldering by the door
There's a child upstairs crying out for you
Yet despite my heart I can say no more

You turn away when I reach out to you
And so the old routine begins anew
Yet despite my heart I can say no more
It's a conversation we've had before
